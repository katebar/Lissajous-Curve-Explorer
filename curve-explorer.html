  <h1> Lissajous Curves</h1>
  <h2> Understanding Sine Curves </h2>
  <p>In order to understand Lissajous curves, it's important to solidify our understanding of sine curves and their corresponding equations.</p>
  <p>We can draw a sine curve with the following equation:<br>
    y(t) = Asin(2&pi;ft + &delta;) = Asin(&omega;t + &delta;)</p>
    <p>Wherein:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>A</b> is amplitude (the peak distance of the wave function from zero)
        <li><b>2&pi;f, or &omega;</b>, is angular frequency (number_of_circular_rotations * 2&pi; / sec, or the angle covered per second)
          <li> <b>t</b> is time
            <li> <b>&delta;</b> is phase shift (or where an oscillation is at t=0)
      </ul>
    <h2>Applying this Knowledge to Lissajous Curves</h2>
    <p>Lissajous curves are formed via a system of parametric sine equations (in other words, sine equations for which we can change certain parameters, or inputs):</p>
    <p>x(t) = Asin(at+&delta;),<br>
      y(t) = Bsin(bt)<br><br>
      Unlike our original sine equation, the x and y coordinates of a Lissajous curve are generated by two different functions of time, wherein:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are amplitude
      <li><b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are angular frequency
          <li> <b>t</b> is time
            <li> <b>&delta;</b> is phase shift
            </ul>
      <p>While A and B will affect the size of the curve, the a:b ratio, along with &delta; (or the phase shift) will affect the shape of the curve.</p>
      <h2>Lissajous Curve Explorer</h2>
      <p>Draw your own Lissajous curves by adjusting the aforementioned parameters! Note: t is set at 8 seconds. As you draw, consider the following situations...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What happens if a or b is set to zero?
          <li>What happens when a and b are the same number? Does this change as the phase shift increases from 0 to 5?
            <li>What happens when a is larger than b, and vice versa?
              <li>How can you make the curve wider? Taller?
      </ul>
